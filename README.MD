Ripple will be a thought board and inspiration aggregator. Its animations will simulate the ripple of waves across water. Users will be able to collect links, aphorisms and various media that inpsire them. These will appear in a few boxes comprising carefully selected categories. Ripple will keep track of a users most current interests, unlike an exhaustive (exhausting) bookmark collection. Data modelling will done through Backbone JS, as well as a light Node JS server connected to Mongo DB. Animated rippling will dynamically change as users scroll through the site. Ripples will bounce off of the various dom nodes. Animation will be done with Processing js.
