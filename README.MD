Ripple is a thought board and inspiration aggregator. I designed its animations to simulate the ripple of waves across water (or thoughts across the mind). Users are able to collect bookmarks and aphorisms that inpsire them. These bits of inspiration appear in bubbles comprising carefully selected categories. 

The rippling animation is triggered as a user scrolls through their collection. I wanted to visualize the way a user interacts with a text-based site, and to energize the familiar experience of scrolling down a page. The animated ripples are SVG paths which are generated dynamically, using vector geometry converted into Bezier curves. 

Ripple is a single-page app with Ajax functionality. Data is modelled with Backbone JS. I have structured a light Node JS server connected to Mongo DB on the back end.
